# Password Generator
This is a Python program for generating random passwords. The program prompts the user for the number of letters, numbers, and symbols they would like to include in the generated password. The program then generates a random combination of the specified characters.

## Usage
To run the program, simply execute the password_generator.py script in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user for the desired number of letters, numbers, and symbols. Once the user enters their preferences, the program will generate a random password and print it to the console.

## Example
```
$ python password_generator.py
Enter the number of letters: 12
Enter the number of numbers: 4
Enter the number of symbols: 2

Your generated password is: aB3#sT4@dF5^gH6&jK7*
```

## Note
This program is a part of my day 5 project of 100 days of python code.
A test version of this program is available on [replit](https://replit.com/@labelisaiah/Random-password-generator?v=1) . Feel free to test it out and give feedbacks for improvements.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x

## Dependencies
This program does not have any dependencies outside of the Python standard library.

## Limitations
+ The maximum length of the password is limited to the maximum value of an integer on your system.
+ The program does not validate user input and assumes that the user will input valid integers for the number of letters, numbers, and symbols.
